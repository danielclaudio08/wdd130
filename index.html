        <p>Hi! My name is Daniel Claudio, 24 years old. I'm from Caloocan City, Philippines.            
            I got married to my beautiful wife, Jennie, a month ago.          
            I'm excited to learn more about web development and how it 
            can help with our daily tasks and future careers.</p>

        <p>"The Philippines is a beautiful archipelago in Southeast Asia, 
            known for its stunning landscapes and rich culture. One of its natural wonders is Mayon Volcano, 
            famous for its nearly perfect cone shape. Located in Albay, it's an active volcano that draws visitors 
            for its beauty and frequent eruptions" (Philippine History). </p>
